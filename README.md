# 💖 **A Heartfelt Valentine’s Surprise** 💌  

This is more than just a website—it's a love letter written in code, a heartfelt confession crafted with all my love and sincerity. Every pixel, every animation, every tiny detail was designed with one person in mind—**you.**  

🌹 **On this special day, I just want you to know…**  
You are someone truly special, someone who makes my heart race like the little heartbeat line you see on this page. Every moment spent thinking about you is like a love song playing on repeat—soft, warm, and filled with emotions I can’t quite put into words.  

💕 **This website is my way of saying… I like you.**  
I poured my heart into creating this, hoping that when you see it, you’ll feel the sincerity behind every design choice, every color, and every tiny detail.

May your day be as beautiful as your smile. 🌸
